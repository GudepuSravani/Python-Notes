# Python-Notes :Detail Notes
1> what is coding ? 
.coding is a implement list of step by step instrucions that get computers to do what you want to do.
.coding makes it possible for us to create a computer software, gAMES, apps of website.

2> what is programming ?
.programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
.programming can be done using a variety of computer programming language such as javascript,python,c++.
>High level language : it is programming friendly language.
>Low level language : it is machine friendly language binary language computer can understand.

3> what is complier ?
complier are programs that convert source code written in a high level programming language to a lower-level programming language,such as a machine code,for creating an excutable program.
high level language ===> low level language
ex: c,c++,c#,java.

# phases of complier :
>lexical analysis
>syntax analysis
>semantic  "
>intermediate "
>optimization "
>code generation  "

differenes between  complier & interpreter
    complier                      interpreter 
< At a time execution          >line by line execution
< fast                         > slow 

# Byte code :
python is usually called interpreted language,however ,it combines compiling and interpreting when we executed a source code. 

# what is python ?
In Python, dynamic typing means:
👉 You don’t need to declare the data type of a variable.
👉 Python automatically decides the type while running the program.
Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language used to build software, websites, apps, and analyze data.

# python history:
started in december 1989 by "Gudio van Rossum" at cwl in Netherland in1991 february 20.
Python comes from BBC's TV  Comedy sketch series.
