# Python-Notes :Detail Notes
1> what is coding ? 
.coding is a implement list of step by step instrucions that get computers to do what you want to do.
.coding makes it possible for us to create a computer software, gAMES, apps of website.

2> what is programming ?
.programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
.programming can be done using a variety of computer programming language such as javascript,python,c++.
>High level language : it is programming friendly language.
>Low level language : it is machine friendly language binary language computer can understand.

3> what is complier ?
complier are programs that convert source code written in a high level programming language to a lower-level programming language,such as a machine code,for creating an excutable program.
high level language ===> low level language
ex: c,c++,c#,java.

# phases of complier :
>lexical analysis
>syntax analysis
>semantic  "
>intermediate "
>optimization "
>code generation  "

differenes between  complier & interpreter
    complier                      interpreter 
< At a time execution          >line by line execution
< fast                         > slow 

# Byte code :
python is usually called interpreted language,however ,it combines compiling and interpreting when we executed a source code. 

# what is python ?
In Python, dynamic typing means:
👉 You don’t need to declare the data type of a variable.
👉 Python automatically decides the type while running the program.
Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language used to build software, websites, apps, and analyze data.

# python history:
started in december 1989 by "Gudio van Rossum" at cwl in Netherland in1991 february 20.
Python comes from BBC's TV  Comedy sketch series.
# Features of python :
-Free & open source easy to code.
-easy to Read.
-object -oriented language.
-graphical user interface(GUI) programming support HLL.
-Easy to debug.
-large standard library.

# Module:
A module is a set of METHODS  or  FUNCTIONS are ready to be used somewhere else.
# Package
A package is a set of MODULES  is called package.
# Library :
Alibrary is a set of PACKAGE is called library.
# Framework :
mvt,mvc,model,view,template,controll.

# python libraries and frameworks: -
# MACHINE LEARNING :
  >Numpy
  >pandas
  >Matplotlib
  >sea Born
  >scipy
  >seikit learn
  >keras
  >pytorch
  >theano
  >tensor flow
# web development :
* Django
* Flask
* cheerypy
* pyramid
* web2py
* turbogears
* cubic web
# Data Visualization :
- Matplotlib
- seaBorn
- scipy.org
- pygal
# Data modeling :
Tensor flow 
pytorch
keras 
learn
# DataBase :
Sql alchemy

# Variable :
-Python variable is container which store values.
-we do not need to declare variable before using them or declare their type.
-A variable is created the moment we first assign a value it.
-A python variable is a name given to a memory location.
-
EX :
int a = 10     (wrong)
    a = 10     (right) dynamically type
    
    hari (variable) = 24 (values)
# Rules for creating variables in python :
-A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
-A variable name cannot start with a number.
-A variable name can only contain alpha-number characters and underscores.(A-Z,0-9,&_)a,b
-A variable name are case-sensitive(name ,Name are three different variables)
-The reserved words (keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.
# python keyword :-
-python keywords are reserved words.They are used to python interpreters to understand the program.
-keywords define the structure of programs.we can't use keywords to name program entities such as variables,
   classes and function.
There are 35 keywords .
# Variable cases :-
There are 3 types of variable cases :-
1> camel Case   : sravani (G)oud  should be captial in second word
2> snake case   : sravani(_)goud  should be between them.
3> pascal case  : SravaniGoud     last & first should me captial.
 
 control statements there are three types : 
 conditional statements
 python it can esay too compiler

 # What is GIL?
GIL = Global Interpreter Lock
It allows only one thread to execute at a time in CPython.


 it will be used in artificial intelligences and maxhine learning.
